Project Goals:

Pick an existing website of your choice. The website must be a business, service, or organization, and not a personal site for you or someone you know. Please pick a site that needs to be redesigned because it’s not done very well. Redesign this site for your final project but give it a new name – your final project will be inspired by this site but will not use the name from this site (to avoid copyright issues surrounding the use of someone’s name, logo and content).

The project must have at least three pages. (eg. home, about, projects)

Take into account:

The Grid
Color Palette
Navigation
Design Principles
Typography

Specifications:

-Optimize your design for a browser resolution size of 1024 x 768 (remember the dimension of your page should be 990 pixels wide and “the fold” is around 560 pixels. The page should not end at 560 pixels!)

-Complete 5 HTML pages with ONE external CSS file

-Must use HTML text for the main content of your site, not images.

-Please use images you have created, or free or royalty-free images on your site. (See possible sources below).
